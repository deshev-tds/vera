Research Plan for Penicillin R-group Stability Analysis:

1. First, understand penicillin structure basics
2. Identify common R-group variations in penicillin derivatives
3. Research how these variations affect stability
4. Find specific examples and data supporting the relationships
5. Determine real-world applications of this concept
